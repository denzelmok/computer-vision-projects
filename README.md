Mostly tasks from university for a Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Network course, the notebooks were created in colab, so it might be a bit hard to display in github.

flowers-classification: classifying flower class using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning

object-detection-ssd: detecting objects (fruits in a synthetic dataset) using Tensorflow's object detection API
