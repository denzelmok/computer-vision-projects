This notebook is a snapshot of my work from university for a deep learning course.
The task involved classifying images based on their features extracted and predicted through a convolutional neural network (CNN).
The CNN was implemented through keras, using transfer learning from ImageNet to get pre-trained weights and applied onto the flowers dataset.

The dataset is from: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html
